# Base URL of your backend API (eg. https://api.example.com)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:3001

# Socket.IO server URL (same origin as your backend if socket.io is attached)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3001

# These let you customize the endpoints if your backend doesn't use the defaults:
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_STATIC=/move           # non-learning bot
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_LEARNING=/move-learn   # learning bot (change if your backend uses a different path)

# Endpoint to persist bot-game data
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_SAVE=/save
